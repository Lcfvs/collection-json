Collection+JSON Media Type

This repo is a 'stub' for issues surrounding the development and maintenance of the Collection+JSON media type.
See: 
Specification: http://amundsen.com/media-types/collection/
Discussion Group: https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups#!forum/collectionjson

Feel free to log issues here right now.
I'll also post the spec here to allow fork and pull.
Soon, I'll open up a process for registering and reviewing CJ extenstions, too.
