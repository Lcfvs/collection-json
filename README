# Collection+JSON Media Type

This repo is a 'stub' for issues surrounding the development and maintenance of the Collection+JSON media type.
See: 
- Specification: http://amundsen.com/media-types/collection/
- Discussion Group: https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups#!forum/collectionjson

I've added a section on extensions w/ links to any related discussions. I'll also post the spec here sometime soon. 

I have also started a section on very simple server & client examples (see "basic" folder here). These will increase over time.

Feel free to fork/pull on this repo to add new proposed extensions, etc. anytime.

Thanks!

MCA
